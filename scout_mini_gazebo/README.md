# Scout Mini Robot at ELTE - Gazebo Simulation 

## Dependencies

### Robot Models
First clone the robot gazebo models and URDF files from the official source to your catkin workspace
```
git clone https://github.com/agilexrobotics/ugv_gazebo_sim.git
```

Go through the official docs once and install dependencies. Remember to install them for your own distro (noetic etc.) 


### Camera
```
git clone https://github.com/issaiass/realsense2_description
git clone https://github.com/issaiass/realsense_gazebo_plugin
```

### LiDAR
```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/velodyne_simulator.git
```

### Point Cloud to Laser Scan
```
git clone https://github.com/Umar-Senpai/pointcloud_to_laserscan.git
```

### RVIZ Navigation
```
git clone https://github.com/autolaborcenter/rviz_navi_multi_goals_pub_plugin.git
```

## Usage
Spawn the scout_mini in a gazebo world first:
```
roslaunch scout_mini_gazebo scout_v2_minimal.launch
```

We can teleoperate the robot using:
```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

Now, you can run the octomap server:
```
roslaunch scout_mini_gazebo scout_v2_octomap.launch
```

Or you can also run the Navigation module which navigates the robot to different points using RVIZ
```
roslaunch scout_mini_gazebo navigation_4wd.launch
```

These packages will work almost the same way as in the real robot. The only change is instead of using rf2o laser odometry, we are using odom.py file to generate odometry.
