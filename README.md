# Delivery Robot using AgileX Scout Robot
This project will contain the ROS packages necessary to run the project.

We have built a gazebo simulation with the packages provided with the real scout robots. This will enable us to do the same things (exporting maps, navigation with RVIZ etc.) in gazebo as we did with the real robots. Follow the instructions inside `scout_mini_gazebo` package for testing.
